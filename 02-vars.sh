## Variable - Variables are nothing but a name that is assigned to a set of data

## Declare a variable
#VARNAME=DATA (NO spaces)
a=10

## Access a variable - $VARNAME
echo A - $a

# a=10 has been hardcoded manually, however we need the data dynamically
# You can receive data dynamically in two ways:
# 1. User Input
# 2. Use script to find out with other commands

# Command Substitution
# VARNAME=$(command)

# Access variable from Shell
echo C - $c
